Baby Name Dataset Visualization Project 
-

This dataset is from the city of New York which lists the most popular names in New York. This dataset includes data from 2011 up until 2021 which only covers New York. It has not been updated since 2021. Names that are given more than 10 times are included in the dataset, so unique/rare names are not included. Our aim for this project is to analyze the popularity of babynames based on their ethncity but also shifts in top ranked baby names to look at the impacts given names can have in society.
